Summary words?
Making things?
I like to build things that have never been built. (Disclaimer, some things in my portfolio have, in fact, been built before)

Portfolio
20 Years of Studio Ceramics:
I enjoyed ceramics so much that I told my high school art teacher that I wasn’t going to follow her program anymore and would just be doing ceramics. I’ve played with this on and off since 2003.
Apartment: Table/Kitchen Shelves
Sometimes New York City studio apartments are a bit bare. See these kitchen shelves I built from some old ceiling joists found in a workshop basement. I built this table from the same.
An NYC road construction crew abandoned these boards. I think they were used as a retaining wall during road maintenance projects. I found a better use for them :)
A weird infinity mirror:
This kept me busy after I broke my clavicle in the middle of the pandemic.
Submarine
Columbia University Senior Design Project
Laser Pottery
My Master’s Thesis project for Dr. Shree Nayar. This project combine (find the writeup!!)
Functional Pottery
A personal project, inspired by the lack of interesting modeling software options built specific to conventional ceramic 3D printers. 
LF3D Printer for Clay
I wanted to be able to print extremely big pottery.
LED End Table? WIP
A special case project for the LF3D printer
Wall Mounted MAME
To mitigate my anxiety that people don’t enjoy themselves while visiting my apartment.
Burning Man Bicycle
Kinda self explanatory.. I want to be very clear that this was for BM 2022, I had several people chase me through the desert to ask about this thing, and my partner started getting pretty annoyed about it..
