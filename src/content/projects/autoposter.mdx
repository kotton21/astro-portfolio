My 3d printer needed a personality. So I built this system to emulate a robot artist personality on an instagram account that can automatically post content and respond to instagram user comments.

The project result is shown at [@autopot.ter](https://www.instagram.com/autopot.ter/). Definitely visit the instagram account for a better understanding of how this thing works. My text description below is lacking in examples..

{/* https://dash.elfsight.com/apps/instagram-feed */}
import InstagramFeed from '../../components/InstagramFeed.astro';
import CenteredImage from '../../components/CenteredImage.astro';
import { siteConfig } from '../../config/site';

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <InstagramFeed widgetId="6bd7dd25-1e56-4a93-82f7-ab88bea62769" />
</div>


## Goal
The basic goal of the system is to present the 3d printer as a sentient robot artist. 

The system has two primary components:
- Content generation: auto-generate instagram posts
- Instagram account control: Posting videos, and autoreplying to comments


The system automatically generates content from a catalog of existing images and videos of my art, then it manages instagram posts and comments from its personality.

## System Flow Diagram:

  alt="Autoposter System FlowDiagram" 
  lightboxId="autoposter-system-diagram" 
/>

The system has access to the following resources to use in content generation:
- Media Library: 
    - A collection of timelapse videos captured by the 3d printer
    - Images and videos of Completed Works
    - Build videos of the 3d printer being constructed
- System Instructions: 
    - Description of the media library's contents and filenames
    - JSON2Video Documentation and examples
- Instagram insights (new followers, post history, statistics)
- A Personality/History document of the 3d printer's "personality"


## Basic flow:
1. Request most recent instagram insights
2. Request list of media files from the media library
3. Upload all resources to a GPT model
4. Request a "social media post" from the gpt model based on the resources, and the personality document
5. Parse the response, and upload the response to the json2video api
6. Download the video from the json2video api
7. Upload the video and it's caption to instagram


## Results:
The system is live and posting to the [https://www.instagram.com/autopot.ter/](https://www.instagram.com/autopot.ter/) instagram account. The AI naturally figured out that, for some reason, viewers prefer videos of failed prints over successfull completions.  It started posting exclusively failures for a while until I curtailed the behavior. That said, it is posting slightly more interesting content, but still struggles with in-vidoe label placement, and the personality isn't well developed.
