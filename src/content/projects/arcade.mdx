blurb: "Likely the only shu sugi ban arcade cabinet in existence?"
description: "A custom MAME arcade cabinet I built. It features a shu sugi ban wood finishing, fully custom designed shape to accomodate an outer seated monitor and LED strip accent lighting, and a raspberry pi controller.

The original reason I built this was to play the game \"Nothing Good Can Come of This\", but this (closed source) game this wouldn't load on raspberry pi for whatever reason so I need to replace the pi with a windows minipc :("

TODO: The original reason I built this was to play the game "Nothing Good Can Come of This", but (closed source) game this wouldn't load on raspberry pi for whatever reason so I need to replace the pi with a windows minipc :(
