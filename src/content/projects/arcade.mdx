Title: Nothing Good Can Come of This; Mine
Description: A custom MAME arcade cabinet I built. Features are shu sugi ban wood finishing, fully custom designed shape to accommodate an outer seated monitor, and a Raspberry Pi controller.

TODO: The original reason I built this was to play the game "Nothing Good Can Come of This", but (closed source) game this wouldn't load on Raspberry Pi for whatever reason so I need to replace the Pi with a Windows mini PC :(
