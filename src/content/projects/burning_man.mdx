## WIP: Printing Playa Dust

As may found out in 2022, playa dust mud is really close to clay.. ðŸ˜‚ 

This was my first (off-playa) test of printing playa dust with my paste 3d printer.  It's much 'stickier' than conventional clay and so it doesn't print very cleanly, but a bigger nozzle and some woter content fine-tuning should help. I'll bring my printer to playa next year (2026) to print directly on-playa!"
