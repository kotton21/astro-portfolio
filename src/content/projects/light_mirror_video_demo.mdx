## The Light Mirror Project

This demo showcases the **videoFirst template** with cycling media functionality. The template automatically cycles through all the media files in the project, creating a dynamic, engaging presentation.

### Key Features Demonstrated:

- **Automatic Cycling**: Media cycles every 4 seconds with smooth transitions
- **Mixed Media Support**: Seamlessly handles images, videos, and GIFs
- **Ken Burns Effect**: Images get subtle panning animations
- **Video Playback**: Videos auto-play when they become active
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Technical Implementation:

The videoFirst template uses the project's `media` array to create a cycling hero section that's functionally identical to the home page cycling media, but uses the project's own assets instead of hardcoded portfolio highlights.

### Media Mix:

This demo includes:
- **4 Images**: Static shots showing different aspects of the build
- **3 Videos**: Dynamic animations showing the mirror in action  
- **1 GIF**: A 4-frame animated sequence

The cycling creates a compelling narrative that shows both the construction process and the final infinity mirror effect in action.

### Perfect for Video-Heavy Projects:

The videoFirst template is ideal for projects that have:
- Multiple videos showcasing different aspects
- A mix of static images and dynamic content
- Projects where motion is a key part of the story
- Build processes that benefit from showing progression

This template transforms a static project page into an engaging, dynamic experience that keeps visitors engaged and showcases the full scope of your work.
