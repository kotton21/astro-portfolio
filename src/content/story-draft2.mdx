What are the 3 things I really want people to know about me?
1. I'm really thoughtfully artistic
2. I'm highly versatile?? or I'm highly technically competant
3. I'm personable and easy to get along with!

In a world of brutally functional technology, nothing hits the spot like the clever symmetry of art and science in the creation of a thing.  Most of my personal work stems from this idea; striving to merge artistic creativity with thoughtful science.

Before 3D Printed Ceramics, [Laser Pottery](/projects/laser_pottery) was my first attempt at this concept.  In fact, most of my ceramics projects (beyond [handbuilding](/projects/20yearsofpottery)), seek to infuse the tech, and the tech production process, into the art.
