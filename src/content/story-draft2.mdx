What are the 3 things I really want people to know about me?
1. I'm really thoughtfully artistic
2. I'm highly versatile?? or I'm highly technically competant
3. I'm personable and easy to get along with!

In a world of brutally functional technology, nothing hits the spot like the clever symmetry of art and science in the creation of a thing.  Most of my personal work stems from this idea; striving to merge artistic creativity with thoughtful science.

      My work with 3D Printed Pottery is my cleanest example of artistic synergy with it's technological process.

There's much more to do within the ecosystem of 3d printed pottery.  I've built a conveyor system to automate multiple print jobs to scratch my own automation itch.  I plan to anthroporopize my 3d printer into a sentient robot artist.  Ando to support the idea of the robot artist, I've also been developing a social media content auto-gemerator and moderator bot for the project.

      Autoposter is a social media content gemerator and moderator bot. It automatically posts the results of its print jobs, and responds to comments on the instagram account.

Before 3D Printed Ceramics, [Laser Pottery](/projects/laser_pottery) was my first attempt at this concept.  In fact, most of my ceramics projects (beyond [handbuilding](/projects/20yearsofpottery)), seek to infuse the tech, and the tech production process, into the art.

{/* ## Purpose: 
Really this should be some kind of illustrated cover letter. It should quickly illustrate the breadth of my skills and experience.
- Technical skills: 
- working with hands
- hardware / software hacking
- i can learn/build whatever needs to be built
- versatility and adaptable to new projects, requirements
- working with a wide range of tools and technologies */
